    <h1 class="title">Space Shuttle Missions between 1981 - 2011</h1>
    <p class="text">The Space Shuttle is a retired, partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system operated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S. 
        National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the Space Shuttle program. 
        Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS), taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft where
         it was the only item funded for development.</p>
    <p class="text">The first orbiter, Enterprise, was built in 1976 and used in Approach and Landing Tests (ALT), but had no orbital capability. 
        Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. 
        Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003, with a total of 14 astronauts killed. 
        A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, Endeavour, was built in 1991 to replace Challenger. 
        The three surviving operational vehicles were retired from service following Atlantis's final flight on July 21, 2011. 
        The U.S. relied on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport astronauts to the ISS from the last Shuttle flight until the 
        launch of the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission in May 2020.</p>
