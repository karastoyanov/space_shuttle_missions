    <h1 class="title">Total Missions Number: 135</h1>
    <p class="text">American's Space Shuttle perfomed 135 orbital flights. The first orbiter, Enterprise, was built in 1976 and used 
        in Approach and Landing Tests (ALT), but had no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: Columbia, 
        Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003, 
        with a total of 14 astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, Endeavour, was built in 1991 to 
        replace Challenger. The three surviving operational vehicles were retired from service following Atlantis's final flight on 
        July 21, 2011. </p>
